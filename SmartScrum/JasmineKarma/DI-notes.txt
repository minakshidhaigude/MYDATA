D.I --
when we create angular app,like we have to use anything like we have to call anydata
from the api side so generally what we do we write that api in the service so we create
the service and in that service we call the api and then in the component side whenever we
need that particular service so what we do we inject that service into the constructor
using the then using the instance we use that one so DI is basically kind of design pattern
in which a class requires dependencies from the external sources rather than creating them
