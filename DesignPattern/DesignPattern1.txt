Smart Code - Design Pattern1
 
1.Creational --.> 
              singleton
              Factory method
              Abstract factory (factory of factories) use when have a family of 
              objects
2.Structural -- relationship between classes
                Adapter- is act like bridge between svc prv interface and client interface
                Decorator--to change the beha of another class without modifying the src code of original class
                            purpose -- add extra behavior
                Facade
3.Behavioral--> how entities communicate with each other or object communication
               Iterator - traverse the ele thr collection 
               Aggregate obj(has a relationship) use foreach() 
               Observer-- pub/sub
               Mediator
